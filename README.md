NOTE ON GITHUB:
You'll find on github 2 versions of network.xx neuron.xx test_oneNeuron.cpp test_twoNeurons.cpp. 
This is due to a change in my hierarchy during the project. The files within the folder src are the final one. 
But as I wanted to keep the old files to still have an history of my commits, I kept the older version.
